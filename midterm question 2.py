#Write me a script that creates a function called descriptive, 
#which, when passed a list of numbers, will return the mean, median,
# sample standard deviation, and population standard deviation, along
# with appropriate titles. For example:

#Mean is: 45.5666

#Median is: 23.4589

#...and so forth

#Put your function in a script and also have the script 
#call the function on a set of 10 random numbers to show me that it works.
